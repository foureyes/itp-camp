### Source Material

See the first two chapters of the second edition of [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/2nd_edition/preview/) for more detailed information:

* [Chapter 1 - Values](http://eloquentjavascript.net/2nd_edition/preview/01_values.html)
* [Chapter 2 - Program Structure](http://eloquentjavascript.net/2nd_edition/preview/02_program_structure.html)

### Logical Connectives

Just as we use the words AND and OR as a part of our daily vocabulary, we can also use them when we code to connect two expressions.

In JavaScript, AND is written as &&. 
OR is written as ||.

* A && B returns true if and only if BOTH values are true

* A || B returns true if ONE OR BOTH values are true

### Boolean Comparison Operators

* < less than
* <= less than or equal to
* > greater than
* >= greater than or equal to
* != not equal to
* !== not equal to (checks for type)

a < b

* gives back true if a is less than b
* gives back false otherwise

a <= b

* gives back true if a is less than b OR equal to b
* gives back false otherwise
